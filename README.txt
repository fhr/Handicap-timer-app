This project is eventually going to be a phone app for managing handicap road races. 
Customised for my local running club (vphthac.org.uk) but should work for more use cases as well. 
A handicap race is where you set people off at different times based on speed estimates, with the aim being that if they all estimate accurately then they would all *finish* at the same time. 
I'm writing the base code in HTML5 and Jquery, closely following the examples in this book http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449383268/
Right now it's html only but will need soon to port to a phone so that it can incorporate timing elements and also sync to a DB for data storage and for multi-device usage on a single race.
